Games in C

Welcome to my GitHub repository "Games in C"! This project is my first repository as a computer science student, where I share with you my replicas of classic games developed in the C programming language. My goal is to practice my programming skills whith versions of games we all know and love.

Available Games : 
- TicTacToe: A classic replica of the TicTacToe game (also known as Noughts and Crosses), with an additional feature to enable playing against the computer.

- Snake: Currently under development, this replica of the Snake game, done in collaboration with @LudecielDev. Stay tuned for updates.

Technologies : 
The games are entirely developed in C, leveraging its speed and simplicity to create efficient and accessible games.

How to Play:
Each folder in this repository contains the source files for a different game. To play, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the folder of the game you want to play.
- Compile the source code using a make command
- Run the generated executable file or use ./*generated execuatble file* -h for help and usage.

Contributions:
Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions for improvements, bug fixes, or even ideas for new games to develop, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.
